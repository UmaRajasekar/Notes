Lambda evolution
a. Data Center
b. Infrastructure as Service
c. Platform as Service
d. Containers 
e. Serverless

AWS Lambda is a compute service, where you can upload your code and create a Lambda function. AWS Lambda takes care of provisioning and managing the servers that you can use to run the code. You dont have to worry about operating systems, patching, scaling etc.
You can use Lambda in following ways
a. An event driven compute such as changes data to S3 or an Amazon Dynamo DB table
b. Response to your HTTP request.

Lambda can trigger another Lambda and it can interact with other AWS server. Lambda mainly supports Scale-out which is the main advantage.

For API Gateway to interact with different resource, we need to enable CORS(Cross Origin Region)

Exam Tips for EC2 instance:-
-> Know the pricing difference
  -> On demand
  -> Spot
  -> Reserved
  -> Dedicated Hosts
Remember with the Spot instances:-
  -> If you terminate the instance, you pay for the hour
  -> If AWS terminate the spot instance, you get the hour it was terminated in for free.
We have many EC2 types:-
  Few of them are mentioned below:-
  ->General Purpose
  ->Field Programmable Gate Array
  ->High Speed Storage
  ->Graphic Intensive
  ->High Disk Throughput
  ->Dense Storageral
  ->Memory Optimized

EBS consist of
  -> SSD, General Purpose - GP2 - Upto 10000 IOPS
  -> SSD, Provisioned IOPS - 101 - (More than 10000 IOPS)
  -> HDD, Throughput Optimized - ST1 - frequently assed workloads- not applicable for Root volume
  -> HDD, Cold -SC1 - less frequently assessed data.- not applicable for Root volume.
  -> HDD, Magnetic - Standard- cheap, infrequently accessed storage
  
  You cannot mount one EBS volume to multiple EC2 instance. To do so, we need to use EFS instead.
  Termination Protection is off by default. We need to turn it on.
  On the EBS backed volume, when root EBS volume is terminated, it will not terminate associate EBS volume.
  EBS backed root volume can now be encrypted. Also additional volumes can be encrypted.
  
Volumes exists in EBS, they are basically virtual hard disk
Snapshots exists on S3.
We can also take snapshot of the volume and snapshot's volume gets stored in S3.
Snapshots are point in time copies of volume.
Snapshots are incremental.

Snapshots of encrypted volumes are encrypted automatically.
Volumes restored from snapshots are encrypted automatically.
You can share snapshots, only if they are unencrypted.
  These snapshots can be shared with other AWS account or made public.
  To take snapshot of root device of EBS storage, you must stop the instance.
  
Instance Store Volumes are sometime called as Ephemeral Storage.
Instance store volumes cannot be stopped. If the underlying host fails, you will lose your data.
EBS backed volumes can be stopeed and data lose is limited.
While terminating EBS volume, we can tell AWS service to keep the root volume.

Problem:- How you will back up RAID array, when taking snapshots. Snapshots will always delete memory held in cache by applications and OS
Solution:- Take an application consistent snapshot.
  -> Stop all the application writing to disk.
  -> Flush all caches to the disk.
  
    How can we do this?
      -> Freeze the file sysyem.
      -> Unmount the RIAD aray
      -> Shutting down the associated EC2 instance.
      
 AMI - Amazon Machine Imahes
  -> AMI's are regional.
  -> You can also copy AMI to other regions using console, command line or the Amazon EC2 API.

Monitoring
  ->Standard Monitoring= 5 minutes
  ->Detailed Monitoring= 1 minute
  
  CloudWatch is used for performance monitoring.
  CloudTrial is used for auditing
  
CloudWatch
  -> You can create Dashboard.
  -> You can also set Alarms to notify when treshold are hit.
  -> Events: Cloud Watch Events helps you to respond to the state changes in your AWS resources.
  -> Logs- Helps you to log performace details
  
Roles
  -> Very much secure and better than using aws secret key and access key.
  -> Easier to manage.
  -> Roles can be assigned to EC2 instance even after its been provisioned.
