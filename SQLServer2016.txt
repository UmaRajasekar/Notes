Transact SQL is a database programming language based on the Structured Query Language.
  -> A proprietary extension of the SQL standard
  -> Created by Microsoft and Sysbase.
  -> Also referred as 'T-SQL'
Transact SQL is central to working with Microft's hugely popular SQL Server database platform
  -> It is used to create, manage and manipulate SQL server databases.
  -> All applications that communicate with SQL server use T-SQL
Transact SQL is one of the many 'flavors' or proprierty extensions of the SQL language.
  -> MySQL
  -> PL/SQL
  -> Many more..
There is minor differences between T-SQL and PL/SQL
  -> Minor syntax differences
  -> Minor functionality differences
All SQL flavours are based on the SQL standard.

Database
  -> The term 'database' refers to a collection of related data that are easily accessed, managed, and updated.
  -> The advantage of using database from normal dataset is that it can be easily organized, protected from loss, and efficiently managed.
  -> The major actions can be performed using T-SQL are mentioned below:-
    -> INSERT
    -> SELECT
    -> UPDATE
    -> DELETE

Database Structures and Purposes
-> Database structures fall into two categories
  -> OLTP
  -> OLAP
-> OLTP- Online Transaction Processing
  -> Database structure makes inserts, updates and deletes more efficiently.
  -> Reading data from database becomes less effficient over time due to increase in data size over time and data tables structures in database.
-> Online Analytical Processing
  -> Data Warehouse
  -> Loaded with data from OLTP to make reading much efficient.
  -> Data Inserts are not efficient.
-> Most database begin as OLTP as a startup.
-> When data grows, there is always a challenge to maintain number of indexes and usefulness of the indexes to keep data for both query types and maintaining balance between them.
-> Best Pactice: A copy of new data from OLTP is taken and loaded in OLAP on periodic basis and OLAP used for only reporting purposes.
